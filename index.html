        <p style="text-decoration: underline">ABOUT JESUS CHRIST</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">I have come to Love a God who cares unconditionally About us. He gave himself over to death just to save our lives
            He didn't have to do this but he did it any way. It because of his sacrifice on the cross many years ago
            that I can enjoy good health and sound mind. His death gave me life, good health, freedom, etc. When he died, 
            he left us with a comforter called the HolySpirit who teaches me all things. So you see, I am enjoying an excellent
            spirit today because of the Gift of God. I love Jesus so much, How about you?
